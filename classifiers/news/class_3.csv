AppStream Report for Debian - Start AppStream data hints for Debian Welcome Welcome to the AppStream Generator HTML pages These pages exist to provide a user friendly view on the issues discovered by the AppStream metadata generator while extracting metadata from packages in the Debian archive They can also be used to take a look at the raw metadata to spot possible problems with the data itself or the generation process Select a suite buster experimental sid stretch stretch backports stretch updates What is AppStream and DEP 11 AppStream is a cross distro XML format to provide metadata for software components and to assign unique identifiers to software In Debian we parse all XML provided by upstream projects as well as other metadata desktop files and compile a single YAML metadata file from it which is then shipped to users via APT While the official AppStream specification is based on XML Debian uses a YAML version of the format for easier use in existing scripts and for better archive integration This format is called DEP 11 and initially had a much wider scope in enhancing archive metadata than AppStream had Today AppStream covers that as well and DEP 11 is only a YAML version of AppStream The generated metadata can for example be used by software centers like GNOME Software or KDE Discover to display a user friendly application centric view on the package archive It can also be used by other software to find missing plugins codecs fonts etc or simply by users to install software on any Linux distribution without knowing the exact package name More information See AppStream wiki d o for information about AppStream integration and usage in Debian The offical AppStream specification can be found at freedesktop org a description of the DEP 11 YAML format is hosted there as well You can find the source code of the AppStream Generator here Log files of the generator runs are stored in logs machine readable issue hints can be found in hints valid metadata is located in data and all exported media is made available via media Generated by appstream generator v0 7 5 AS 0 12 1
