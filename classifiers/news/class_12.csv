Sunday 18th November 2018The news headlines First geostationary amateur satellite success New RSGB Convention videos on YouTube New version of WSJT XOn Thursday the 15th of November a SpaceX Falcon 9 vehicle lifted off flawlessly at 2046UTC from Cape Canaveral It was carrying the first amateur radio payload destined for geostationary orbit About 32 minutes after launch SpaceX reports the spacecraft was successfully deployed into a geostationary transfer orbit Positioned at 25 5 E the satellite will carry an amateur radio S band and X band payload capable of linking radio amateurs from Brazil to Thailand The recent subject of an AMSAT UK Colloquium presentation Es hail 2 carries two Phase 4 non inverting amateur radio transponders operating in a 2 4GHz up and 10 45GHz down configuration This offers a 250kHz bandwidth linear transponder intended for conventional analogue operations plus an 8MHz bandwidth transponder for experimental digital modulation schemes and DVB amateur television You can see the talk at www youtube com user AMSATUK videosTwo more 2018 RSGB Convention talks are now on YouTube Using drones to measure antenna radiation patterns by Jenny Bailey G0VQH looks at how antenna radiation patterns are difficult to measure because antennas are typically high above the ground A practical method of measuring the radiation field around an antenna could be with a drone This video deals with the CAA restrictions drone selection payload and operation as well as measurement antenna design and plotting the results The second video is An Introduction to SDRs and GNU Radio by Heather Lomond M0HMO She gives an overview of what is in an software defined radio the types of tasks they can do for us and how to get started with them as well as an introduction to some digital signal processing techniques such as IQ Modulation Filters DDS and FFT demodulation Go to rsgb org videos click on the RSGB Convention lectures section and then the RSGB 2018 Convention icon to view these videos A new WSJT X release candidate version 2 0 0 rc4 now is available and the version 2 0 Quick Start Guide has been revised and extended The developers urge anyone upgrading to the new version to read the release notes thoroughly The upgrade requires users to change operator settings so the software may not work straight out of the box when upgrading from previous versions The latest version of WSJT X also removes compatibility with earlier versions of the software in certain circumstances Full information is at https sourceforge net p wsjt mailman message 36465968 It is vital that we contribute to the debate around spectrum use Former RSGB Chairman Graham Murchie G4FSG recently made a presentation on behalf of all UK radio amateurs to the UK Spectrum Policy Forum a body that advises the government He also led the subsequent discussion supported by RSGB General Manager Steve Thomas M1ACB and RSGB Spectrum Forum Chair Murray Niman G6JYB Topics included the shortage of practical skills in the radio arena the social and economic aspects of spectrum use and examples of where the RSGB is encouraging development of scarce skills and using them to good effect You can see the presentations at tinyurl com GB2RS 1811ALithuania and Montenegro are the latest countries active on 60m Lithuania s telecomms regulator has enabled the new WRC 15

event stations must be open to the public so our free publicity can help make your efforts more widely known Now the contest newsToday the 18th the UK Microwave Group s Low Band contest runs from 1000 to 1400UTC Using all modes on the 1 3 to 3 4GHz bands the exchange is signal report serial number and locator On Tuesday the 1 3GHz UK Activity Contest runs from 2000UTC to 2230UTC Using all modes the exchange is signal report serial number and locator On Wednesday the Autumn Series contest runs from 2000UTC to 2130UTC This is the SSB leg and is on the 80m band The exchange is signal report and serial number The big contest this month is the CQ Worldwide DX CW Contest over the 24th and 25th Conditions are unlikely to be good but at least CW is a narrowband mode so really weak signals should be more copyable than on other modes It starts at 0000UTC on the 24th and runs until 2359UTC on the 25th Using all contest bands from 1 8 to 28MHz the exchange is signal report and CQ Zone which for the UK is 14 Now the radio propagation report compiled by G0KYA G3YLA and G4BAO on Friday the 16th of November The predicted bad geomagnetic conditions forecast for last weekend didn t turn out to be quite so bad after all The Kp index only rose to four on the tenth and then conditions settled again despite a large coronal hole on the Sun s surface However reports did come in of poor conditions on 80 metres on Monday evening during the RSGB 80m Autumn Series contest A good guide to conditions for inter G or near vertical incidence skywave propagation is always the ionosonde data at propquest co uk The site showed that the critical frequency which is the maximum frequency at which signals launched vertically into the ionosphere are returned dropped as low as 3 16MHz on Monday evening This so called critical frequency or FoF2 meant the ionosphere couldn t support close in 80 metre signals they basically carried on out into space rather than being returned to Earth This may be a trend we see in the evenings throughout the winter especially with a solar flux index as low as 67 as we have been seeing The only answer is to move to Top Band or make do with VHF and UHF Next week NOAA predicts more of the same with an SFI of around 68 70 Geomagnetic conditions are predicted to be more settled though with a maximum Kp index of two This means daytime maximum useable frequencies are likely to be around 18 or 19MHz over a 3 000km path There have been the occasional openings during the day up to 21 and even 28MHz but these are likely to be fleeting and generally unreliable Night time MUFs over a 3 000km path may struggle to reach 9 12MHz at times with 40 or more likely 80 metres being the highest reliable band for DX And now the VHF and up propagation news It looks like a good Tropo spell coming up especially over the eastern side of the country with some good paths across the North Sea to northern Europe and Scandinavia This is due to a strong temperature inversion set up by a large area of high pressure over Scandinavia As this high drifts away towards Iceland the Tropo will decline and low pressure will take over for southern areas by mid week This could introduce some coastal showers especially along the English Channel and over the southern North Sea which may bring some chance of rain scatter for the microwave bands Today we should still be in the tail end of last night s Leonid meteor shower so look for enhanced meteor scatter paths Moon declination goes positive tomorrow so the week will see increasingly long Moon windows and path losses will fall as the week progresses And that s all from the propagation team this week BM 2cW67GEKkHGonXKZLCzouLLxnLym3azS8r Nov 18 13 50 raw This is hillarious Do you actually believe this bullshit Throw
