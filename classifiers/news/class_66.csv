contest ends its 40 hour run at 1600UTC today the 2nd of December It uses CW only The exchange is just the signal report although American and Canadian stations will also send their ARRL or RAC section number Also today the 144MHz Affiliated Societies contest runs from 1000 to 1600UTC Using all modes on the 144MHz band the exchange is signal report serial number and locator The UK Six Metre Group s Winter Marathon began on the 1st of December and runs until the end of January There are no specific operating periods Just work as many Locator squares as you can when you can using any mode on the 50MHz band On Tuesday the 144MHz FM Activity Contest runs from 1900 to 2000UTC using FM only It is immediately followed by the all mode 144MHz UK Activity Contest from 2000 to 2230UTC The exchange for both contests is signal report serial number and locator Next weekend it s the ARRL 10m Contest that runs from 0000UTC on the 8th to 12359UTC on the 9th Using CW and SSB the exchange is signal report and serial number with American and Canadian sending their State or Province code Now the radio propagation report compiled by G0KYA G3YLA and G4BAO on Friday 30th November The CQ Worldwide CW contest last weekend showed that you can work DX with zero sunspots Reports show that stations as far west as Arizona and California plus the Caribbean were workable from the UK on 20 metres plus there were reports of some limited F2 layer openings on 10 metres Chris G0DWV even reported an afternoon greyline opening to Japan on 80m using a four square antenna array for the band The sun remained spotless last week and geomagnetic conditions were very settled which no doubt helped the HF DX The Kp index never rose above two and was often at zero for long periods However at the time this report was being prepared there was still an alert out for potentially unsettled conditions on Friday 30th and across the weekend due to ongoing coronal hole activity NOAA predicts that next week will see the solar flux index pegged at 68 again Conditions should be a little more settled geomagnetically with a maximum K index of three for most of the week Conditions may be a little worse on Friday the 7th and Saturday the 8th due to a high speed solar wind stream from a recurrent coronal hole that will become Earth facing again This is a good time to start to think about the lower bands Eighty and 160 metres are starting to come into their own with the longer nights If you have never worked the USA on 80m then it might be worth looking around UK sunrise There is often transatlantic SSB activity around the top of the band especially 3790 3800kHz in the early morning And now the VHF and up propagation news There is a distinctly unsettled look to the charts again for the next week This means that Tropo will not be a big player and the only weather related DX option is probably limited to some occasional rain scatter on the microwave bands During the winter months rain scatter is most likely around the coasts than inland Last Tuesday s SHF UK Activity Contest saw the west of the UK missing out as the rain moved east just before the contest started leaving a disturbed troposphere in its wake This highlights the fact that good propagation rarely waits for you if you only operate during contests Rain scatter paths from East Anglia to the North remained good throughout Other options might include some aurora on VHF if we are lucky Space Weather Woman Doctor Tamitha Skov tweeted last week that we might reach solar storm levels at the beginning of December due to the coming fast solar wind So be on the lookout for that There are three small meteor showers this week use Google to find the Make More Miles on VHF website for details And remember that the big Geminids shower is only two weeks away now Moon declination goes negative today so Moon windows will be shorter and of lower elevation as the week progresses Note that the Sun will be very close to the Moon on Friday And that s all from the propagation team this week chan general BM 2cW67GEKkHGonXKZLCzouLLxnLym3azS8r Subject Last Count Using PGP keyservers for decentralised file storage Dec 9
