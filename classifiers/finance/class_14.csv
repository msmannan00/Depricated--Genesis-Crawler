records transactions in bitcoins A novel solution is that this is accomplished without the intermediation of any single central authority since the maintenance of the ledger is performed by a network of communicating nodes running bitcoin software that anyone can join ref name primer Transactions of the form payer X sends Y bitcoins to payee Z are broadcast to this network using readily available software applications Network nodes can validate these transactions add them to their copy of the ledger and then broadcast these ledger additions to other nodes ref name Antonopoulos2014 The block chain Bitcoin transactions are recorded in a public ledger called the block chain The block chain is distributed to independently verify the chain of ownership of any and every bitcoin amount full featured bitcoin software stores its own copy of it Approximately six times per hour a group of accepted transactions a block is added to the block chain which is quickly published to all network nodes This allows bitcoin software to determine when a particular bitcoin amount has been spent which is necessary to prevent double spending in an environment with no central authority Whereas a conventional ledger records the transfers of actual bills or promissory notes that exist apart from it the block chain is the only place that bitcoins can be said to exist in the form of unspent outputs of transactions ref name Antonopoulos2014 Ownership File Bitcoin Transaction Visual svg Simplified chain of ownership ref name paper In reality a transaction can have more than one input and more than one output For every transaction output the block chain registers the address to which the output is encumbered To use the output in a future transaction the payer must digitally sign the transaction using the corresponding private key This prevents unauthorized transfers since only the user knowing the private key can sign the transaction Network can verify the signature using the public key ref name Antonopoulos2014 If the private key is lost the bitcoin network will not recognize any other evidence of ownership ref name primer the coins are then lost and cannot be recovered For example in 2013 one user said he lost 7 500 bitcoins worth 7 5 million at the time when he discarded a hard drive containing his private key ref Template Cite news ref Transactions A transaction must have one or more inputs For the transaction to be valid every input must be a digitally signed and previously unspent output of a previous transaction The use of multiple inputs corresponds to the use of multiple coins in a cash transaction A transaction can also have multiple outputs allowing to make multiple payments in one go A transaction output can be specified as an arbitrary multiple of satoshi Similarly as in a cash transaction the sum of inputs coins used to pay can exceed the intended sum of payments In such case an additional output is used returning the change back to the payer ref name Antonopoulos2014 Mining File Difficulty svg Relative mining difficulty Template Refn Vertical axis relative mining difficulty defined as 1 at 9 January 2009 Higher number means higher difficulty The scale is logarithmic Horizontal axis date ranging from 2009 01 09 to 2014 11 08 As the total network power increases the network adjusts the mining difficulty to make mining always last about ten minutes Therefore the relative mining difficulty also captures the relative power of the network Mining is a record keeping service Template Refn Miners keep the block chain consistent complete and unalterable by repeatedly verifying and collecting newly broadcast transactions into a new group of transactions called a block The new block must contain information that chains it to the previous block and gives the block chain its name It is a cryptographic hash bitcoin uses SHA 256 of the previous block Finally the new block must contain a so called proof of work The proof of work consists of a number called a difficulty target and a number called a nonce which is a jargon for a number used only once Miners have to find such a nonce that gives a hash of the new block smaller than the difficulty target When the new block is created and distributed to the network every network node can easily verify the proof ref name Antonopoulos2014 On the other hand finding the proof requires significant work since for a secure cryptographic hash there is only one method to find the requisite nonce miners try different integer values one at a time e g 1 then 2 then 3 and so on until the requisite output is obtained The fact that the hash of the new block is smaller than the difficulty target serves as a proof that this tedious work has been done hence the proof of work name The smaller the target number the longer on average it will take to find a requisite nonce because the lower the probability that any particular value will produce a hash less than the target The bitcoin system periodically every 2016 blocks adjusts the difficulty target so that the average time the entire network needs to find a nonce is about ten minutes That way as computer hardware gets faster over the years the bitcoin protocol will simply adjust the mining target to make mining always last about ten minutes ref name Antonopoulos2014 For example at the end of April 2014 miners had to try 34 4 quintillion values at average before finding the requisite nonce while at the end of October 2014 it was 154 6 quintillion values at average The proof of work together with the fact that the blocks are chained makes modifications of the block chain extremely hard because an attacker has to modify not just one block but also the subsequent blocks needing to outperform the combined power of the rest of the network which continues adding new blocks to the original honest version of the block chain ref name khanbitcoin Template Cite web ref Supply File Total bitcoins svg Total bitcoins in circulation ref group note name blockchain Horizontal axis date ranging from 2009 01 09 to 2014 11 08 The successful miner finding the new block is rewarded with newly created bitcoins and transaction fees ref name bloombergvance111413 Template Cite web ref Template As of the reward amounts to 25 newly created bitcoins per block added to the block chain To claim the reward a special transaction called a coinbase is included with the processed payments ref name Antonopoulos2014 All bitcoins in circulation can be traced back to such coinbase transactions The bitcoin protocol specifies that the reward for adding a block will be halved approximately every four years Eventually the reward will be removed entirely when an arbitrary limit of 21 million bitcoins is reached c 2140 and record keeping will then be rewarded by transaction fees solely ref name KWY Template Cite web ref Paying a transaction fee is optional but may speed up confirmation of the transaction ref name txnfee Template Cite web ref Payers have an incentive to include such fees because doing so means their transaction will likely be added to the block chain sooner miners can choose which transactions to process ref name EconOfBTC and prefer to include those that pay fees Wallets Template See alsoTemplate Multiple imageBitcoin client software called a bitcoin wallet allows a user to

while secretly mining bitcoins ref name guardian ransomware Security Various potential attacks on the bitcoin network and its use as a payment system real or theoretical have been considered The bitcoin protocol includes several features that protect it against some of those attacks such as unauthorized spending double spending forging bitcoins and tampering with the block chain ref name khanbitcoin Other attacks such as theft of private keys require due care by users Unauthorized spending When Alice sends a bitcoin to Bob Bob becomes the new owner of the bitcoin Eve observing the transaction might want to spend the bitcoin Bob just received but she cannot sign the transaction without the knowledge of Bob s private key ref name primer Double spending A specific problem that an internet payment system must solve is double spending whereby a user pays the same coin to two or more different recipients An example of such a problem would be if Eve sent a bitcoin to Alice and later sent the same bitcoin to Bob The bitcoin network guards against double spending by recording all bitcoin transfers in a ledger the block chain that is visible to all users and ensuring for all transferred bitcoins that they haven t been previously spent ref name primer Race attack If Eve offers to pay Alice a bitcoin in exchange for goods and signs a corresponding transaction it is still possible that she also creates a different transaction at the same time sending the same bitcoin to Bob By the rules the network accepts only one of the transactions This is called race attack since there is a race which transaction will be accepted first Alice can reduce the risk of race attack stipulating that she will not deliver the goods until Eve s payment to Alice appears in the block chain ref Template Cite web ref A variant race attack which has been called a Finney attack by reference to Hal Finney requires the participation of a miner Instead of sending both payment requests to pay Bob and Alice with the same coins to the network Eve issues only Alice s payment request to the network while the accomplice tries to mine a block that includes the payment to Bob instead of Alice There is a positive probability that the rogue miner will succeed before the network in which case the payment to Alice will be rejected As with the plain double spending attack Alice can reduce the risk of a Finney attack by waiting for the payment to be included in the block chain ref Template Cite paper ref History modification The other principal way to steal bitcoins would be to modify block chain ledger entries For example Eve could buy something from Alice like a sofa by adding a signed entry to the block chain ledger equivalent to Eve pays Alice 100 bitcoins Later after receiving the sofa Eve could modify that block chain ledger entry to read instead Eve pays Alice 1 bitcoin or replace Alice s address by another of Eve s addresses Digital signatures cannot prevent this attack Eve can simply sign her entry again after modifying it To prevent modification attacks each block of transactions that is added to the block chain includes a cryptographic hash code that is computed from the hash of the previous block as well as all the information in the block itself When the bitcoin software notices two competing block chains it will automatically assume that the longer one is the valid one Therefore in order to modify an already recorded transaction as in the above example the attacker would have to recalculate not just the modified block but all the blocks after the modified one until the modified chain is longer than the legitimate chain that the rest of the network has been building in the meantime Consequently for this attack to succeed the attacker must outperform the honest part of the network ref name khanbitcoin Each block that is added to the block chain starting with the block containing a given transaction is called a confirmation of that transaction Ideally merchants and services that receive payment in bitcoin should wait for at least one confirmation to be distributed over the network before assuming that the payment was done The more confirmations that the merchant waits for the more difficult it is for an attacker to successfully reverse the transaction in a block chain unless the attacker controls more than half the total network power in which case it is called a 51 attack ref name 51 Template Cite news ref For example if the attacker possesses 10 of the calculation power of the bitcoin network and the shop requires 6 confirmations for a successful transaction the probability of success of such an attack will be 0 02428 ref name paper Selfish mining This attack was first introduced by Ittay Eyal and Emin Gun Sirer at the beginning of November 2013 ref Template Cite web ref The attacker does not normally broadcast the blocks upon finding them He mines his private chain and eventually when somebody finds his own block publishes several blocks at row This makes the honest network abandon their last work and switch to the attacker s branch As a result honest miners lose a significant part of their revenue whilst the attacker increases profits due to changes in relative hashpowers According to the authors it changes the incentives for rational miners and makes them want to join the attacker s pool increasing attacker s hashpower which could potentially lead to 51 attack However other researchers disagree with the conclusion and point out the flaws in the article ref Template Cite news ref In the media A
