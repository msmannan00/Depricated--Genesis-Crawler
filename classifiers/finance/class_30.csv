1 Comment This week the price of bitcoin spiked to a high of 259 an 8 rise in a span of 48 hours Typically market participants and mainstream media hopped on board looking to find reasons to justify this run up on the back of dull trend that has characterized the past 3 months A double bottom a common technical reversal pattern observable on the 4 hourly chart formed a firm base for another attempt at higher prices This time momentum was enough to push through 50 fibonacci level at 240 a level we have observed in past analysis as strong resistance to break since April Currently price has stalled at 260 coinciding with 38 2 fibonacci level Looking at EMAs on the 12 hour time frame price has broken through all of them 30 50 100 and 200 day On higher timeframes however it is far from it On 1 day chart price sits just above the 100 average line while on 3 day charts it has pierced above the 30 day but is slightly below the 50 day What s more on the weekly price is way below all EMAs While the short term looks impressive the long term price action needs to do more to convincingly mark a trend reversal For perspective on 1 day timeframe the 200 day Simple moving average SMA was tested for the first time August 2014 when since prices broke down below it It sits squarely at 259 coinciding with where price move up has currently halted Also lining up with 38 2 fibonacci level In last week s bitcoin price analysis I highlighted a move up to 250 and possibly 270 as a remote possibility to watch on this retracement from the lows 210 213 219 While the speed and momentum of this move was a surprise it was a real possibility Here s how So far since the last top at 303 price went down gradually in a series of impulses and consolidations In fact using EW wave counts it was a 5 wave move down to the bottom 210 and subsequently 213 As per this Elliott Wave analysis the dull sideways move since then including this run up is part of a correction known to take different forms This particular one was flat for a while and is complex It is expected to go up till the grey area labelled 2 Thus the larger move from 303 to 20 is likely a motive wave 1 followed by the current unfolding correction wave 2 A different observation is on a larger picture view where a long term bear trend channel extends from 1163 top in December 2014 down till 280 on the upper and from 410 to 166 on the lower This channel has been respected for 18 months now and is yet to be broken on either the upper or lower limits Price action has been struggling to hold within the larger channel and intersection with micro channels within the larger time frame For example looking at the picture closely price is trending up the purple support line Observing critical points on moves up is important at the points of intersection of upper and lower channel supports and resistance Zooming in closely elaborates this more clearly The first was at 250 marked in red arrow roughly where the run up yesterday eased and the second at around 270 zone marked in a blue arrow In addition I would throw in 283 as another level to watch where the long term upper channel resistance line cuts BITCOIN FUNDAMENTAL NEWS Side Note Irrational Exuberance This week Greece s widely published inability to meet its credit obligations was cited as a catalyst for XBT s price spike Reuters for example ran with the title Bitcoin surges as Grexit worries mount posts best run in 18 months Hindsight bias is a human trait that seeks to find meaning in price movements this headline has all the classic tell tales In my opinion Greece and the price run up are two separate events that just happened to coincide Shrewd traders with access to significant resources can incite market moves in their favor to capitalize on such news Looking at all the headlines it seems to have worked Even more interesting was the opinion of several reddit users from Greece according to them bitcoin adoption trends in their country are closer to zero Winklevoss Twins on Gemini exchange As reported on General Assembly Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss held a live stream talk on the future of bitcoin and their anticipated Gemini exchange and COIN ETF On responding to questions from the audience both reiterated their launch was still on course saying We feel like it s weeks We do feel like we re on the two yard line Goldman Sachs Bitcoin Blockchain Talk Goldman Sachs officially posted a video from a recording in December In it featured a panel comprising of Balaji Srinivasan general partner at Andreessen Horowitz and Jerry Brito executive director at Coin Center The discussion was primarily on Bitcoin s blockchain and its implications on the future of money held in front of an audience of mainstream finance professionals Balaji highlighted the duality of the blockchain and the bitcoin token role as an incentive for the network a fact often left out WEEKLY PRICE FORECAST This week in light of recent price movement I am expecting some consolidation around this zone 245 255 for a while before a further move up towards the points I have highlighted I maintain the final bottom is not yet in and see this as part of a correction Wave 2 of 1 One Elliott Wave rule that applies is Wave 2 cannot retrace more than 100 of Wave 1 Therefore to invalidate this as a correction and make it a serious candidate for a major bull run ie reversal from 18 month bear trend it would have to break past 300 and hold sustainably above this level 18th analysis bitcoin june price 2015 06 18 pesa mic You might also like The
