Bitcoin Blender, anonymous bitcoin mixer Bitcoin Blender not logged in Home Login Forgot password Register Quick mix Welcome to Bitcoin Blender We are a hidden service that mixes your Bitcoins to remove the link between you and your transactions This adds an essential layer of anonymity to your online activity to protect you against Blockchain Analysis For discussion about this mixer and making sure this is the correct url please go to this this forum thread on Bitcointalk org 1 Why Mix Your Coins 2 Why Bitcoin Blender 3 Other Methods 4 Best Practice for Top Level Anonymity 1 Why Mix Your Coins Using Bitcoin does not protect your anonymity This is because Bitcoin works on a public ledger meaning anyone anywhere can see and follow every transaction you ever make From the moment you buy your coins to the moment you cash them out they can be followed And if anything along the way can be linked to your identity for example if you bought or sold using your bank account face to face with cash or even using a voucher from a store with CCTV then an agency with the right tools could theoretically find you without much trouble Classic examples of people who might follow your online activity and reveal your identity are Law Enforcement Agencies somebody with a grudge or hackers who have noticed you are moving large amounts of money around But by mixing your Bitcoins you are essentially breaking the link between your identity and your transactions Bitcoin Blender lets you prevent Blockchain Analysis by swapping your coins for somebody else s In other words you deposit your coins into one pot and we send you coins from another pot breaking the chain 2 Why Bitcoin Blender At Bitcoin Blender we have implemented a range of features that we believe make us one of the best most effective Bitcoin mixing services available Low Randomized Fees 1 3 When you deposit coins into your Bitcoin Blender account we will take a low randomized fee of between 1 3 We make our fees low to keep coin mixing affordable and we randomize the fee to make analysis of our service less predictable In other words if our fee was a standard 2 blockchain analysis would be made more trivial interested parties would need only look for suspected deposits and withdrawals tagged with a 2 modifier Our randomized fee takes this tool away from those who would seek to tie your transactions to you Bonus Program 0 5 If you deposit more than 5 BTC within 7 days your new deposits will give a bonus of 0 5 of the deposit effectively making the fee 0 5 lower for you We believe in showing our high volume users appreciation We have structured this as a bonus rather than a fee rebate in order to maintain the integrity of the 1 3 randomized fee Referral Program 0 5 We have designed a referral program to show our appreciation to our users who see Bitcoin Blender as a streamlined fast and most importantly effective mixer Once combined deposits from a user and his her referred users reaches 10BTC in 7 days the referring user will be credited 0 5 of all deposits A token of appreciation for helping improve Bitcoin Blender by bringing more transactions to the pool Two Factor Authentication with PGP By setting your PGP key in your profile you will activate Two Factor Authentication which means that you have to decrypt a message containing a randomized One Time Password on each login This ensures that only the individual with access to your private key and password can access your account and your funds Up To 5 Simultaneous Deposit Addresses As per coin mixing best practice see part 4 below splitting chunks of money between different wallets and addresses makes your anonymity even stronger With Bitcoin Blender you can send your un mixed coins to 5 different addresses at once they will all show up as a single balance in your account for ease of withdrawal You can then delete them and get new ones Auto Withdrawal If you prefer you can set wallet addresses for auto withdrawal so you do not have to log back in to withdraw your coins Withdraws are scheduled and with random delays for best anonymity Set and forget We take measures to ensure you only have to pass credentials as often as truly necessary Fast Processing Although it is recommended that you let your coins sit for a while among other techniques see part 4 below Bitcoin Blender makes your coins instantly available for withdrawal the moment your deposits are confirmed As is outlined below your withdrawal comes from a totally different pool of coins so your withdrawn coins are never traceable from your deposited coins No logs are saved All server logs and database entries are kept for 10 days only this is to be able to solve support tickets If a deposit address is removed by a user then information is kept for 10 days to be able to process coins that could accidentally be sent to old address Withdraw history is also kept for 10 days Support messages is also kept for only 10 days It is also possible to delete your account if you want your username to be completely gone from the system 3 Other Methods There are several ways of mixing your coins however many of these do not provide the same protection against Blockchain Analysis as Bitcoin Blender and other similar hidden services Perhaps the most common method aside from using a hidden service mixer like Bitcoin Blender is the Coin Join method found on services such as Shared Coin The way this method works is by attaching your transaction to a number of other transactions thereby making it difficult to tell which has gone where And although this method does help maintain a certain degree of anonymity it still provides a level of taint for somebody experienced in Blockchain Analysis Taint can be seen as the trail your transaction leaves behind and although techniques used by services like Shared Coin certainly blur that trail they do not remove it completely for best results you should find a service that sends you coins from a completely different pot 4 Best Practice for Top Level Anonymity As a standalone tool Bitcoin Blender provides a very good level of anonymity for erasing your transaction trail However as with anything you can always take extra precautions to ensure your anonymity remains top notch and offers the greatest protection possible As well as using Bitcoin Blender s basic features we recommend the following 1 Deposit to Multiple Addresses Bitcoin Blender makes available the ability to split your deposit up between five bitcoin addresses at once If an interested party is attempting to locate your deposit of 50BTC their task is made exponentially more difficult because they must attempt to locate five deposits of varying amounts that may or may not add up to 50BTC 2 Delay Your Withdrawals If someone is watching the blockchain and they notice a transaction for 100 BTC at 4 30 followed by another transaction of 98 BTC at 5 00 they might suspect this is a part of the same trail even if there is no hardcore evidence By waiting several hours days or even weeks you are further distancing yourself from association with the coins you wish to mix 3 Withdraw to Multiple Addresses By the same token if you deposit 100btc and withdraw 98btc to a single address this may give somebody watching the Blockchain reason to suspect it is part of the same trail By making multiple withdrawals to different addresses generated by different wallets over a long period of time you are further improving your anonymity Bitcoin Blender makes this simple by allowing you to schedule your withdrawals for points in the future so the task of mixing can be accomplished during a single session As mentioned earlier we take every measure possible to minimize the number of times a user must pass credentials in order to complete the task of mixing 4 Mix In Mix Out Your buy in and buy out are the most vulnerable parts of your transaction trail as they are the most likely points that you will be identified If you do not wish your transactions to be followed mix all coins you buy before you spend them then mix anything you withdraw again on their way back out Bitcoin Blender PGP public key
