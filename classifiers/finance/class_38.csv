Bitcoin, Hayek & distopy: part I ilcosmista posts Bitcoin Hayek distopy part I Edit Preferences Comment Let me say that this site speaks largely about what the real liberalism and its uneducated cousin libertarianism are nothing more then ideological superstructures of big business No more no less I apologize for being tranchant this blog it s a deep inspection for understanding the ethical roots of liberalism and neoclassical paradigm Yes this fucking neoclassical economic paradigm born and dead the last century and resurrected by the money of Mont Pelerin society and friends What s the problem with bitcoins I like to accept them as a donation Yes because Bitcoin is an alternative currency with some benefits that people that understand the importance of privacy well know Another thing is the delirious economical analysis behind that system of payments Paul Krugman is obviously right about it it s not an opinion and you don t need to win a Nobel prize to understand it it s enough a macroeconomic manual of the first year of University Full stop People don t know what money is and what is its purpose ok But how educated people can accept the delirious man page of the Bitcoin software with neoliberal conspiracist propaganda Let s read together ilcopsmista oss man bitcoind DESCRIPTION This manual page documents the bitcoind program Bitcoin is a peer to peer digital currency Peer to peer P2P means that there is no central authority to issue new money or keep track of transac tions Instead these tasks are managed collectively by the nodes of the network Advantages Bitcoins can be sent easily through the Internet without having to trust middlemen Transactions are designed to be irreversible Be safe from instability caused by fractional reserve banking and central banks The limited inflation of the Bitcoin system s money supply is distributed evenly by CPU power throughout the network not monopolized by banks Let s focus on which kind of objectives this software would achieve Advantages Bitcoins can be sent easily through the Internet without having to trust middlemen Fine Why not Why American bankster s government must know everything about my economic activity in the other side of the world by my credit card transactions Why ALL servers of financial transactions are centralized and based in a well known financial dictatorship that kills children and promotes genocides around the world Why It s a good beginning Now the delirious explanation begins Be safe from instability caused by fractional reserve banking and central banks What the fuck the instability caused by fractional reserve banking Is it a joke Ask to Canadian banks what s their fractional reserve And what else What s the problem with central banks Expression of monetary sovereignty of a democratic nation Why do you need to exclude definitively people right to achieve social and democratic objectives What do you have in your mind Maybe the sociopathic ideology of Austrian school Monetarism Friedman and Pinochet Isn t it enough to have fucked up people all around the world by the subversive separation between the Treasure and the central bank giving the main sovereign power to private banksters Better a moderately corrupted democratic government elected than a technocratic oligarchy of wealthy soul corrupted corrupters absolutely unelected But Austrian propaganda is not finished The limited inflation of the Bitcoin system s money supply is distributed evenly by CPU power throughout the network not monopolized by banks Why financial system should need to control directly Bitcoin payments system Why When it can control the exchange for money that you need to pay taxes and the Absolute Evil for Austrians and neocons welfare state Why financial system should need to control it directly when by speculation it can manipulate the Bitcoin market So come on Wake up Financial system is creditor for definition it doesn t want that its debt will devalue by market fluctuations Why should it be worried by limited inflation Financial system doesn t want inflation Don t you know Don t you know that workers in the real democracies have an inflation indexed wage and they can easily pay their house mortgage And please a minimum of intellectual honesty limited inflation Bitcoin is deflationary Do you like deflation Let s read who was Heinrich Br ning and to whom he opened the doors to politic I don t comment the justification about the value of cryptocurrencies the energy spent to solve the problems to mine blocks Where the fuck did you study economy In a mental hospital Do you want to see what deflation is Come in Europe Let s study before to be used as useful idiots That s the end of an hayekian deflationary economy That s a warning of a post keynesian researcher that probably understands better Internet subcultures than Krugman please change that fucking delirious manual It s not a joke People die and suffer for this kind of misunderstandings Add a comment Tags bitcoin Last edited dom 31 gen 2016 22 40 59 UTC Mirror I2P TOR II TAHOE LAFS TOR I FREENET
